# Leadership Photos Recommendation

## Current Status
The website currently uses `img/placeholder.svg` for leadership team photos on:
- Homepage (Michael and Vanessa Sanchez)
- Team page (detailed leadership profiles)
- Contact page (Michael's contact photo)

## Professional Recommendation
For a government contractor website, **actual professional headshots** of Michael and Vanessa Sanchez would be most appropriate rather than generic stock photos.

## Recommended Action
1. **Schedule professional photography session** for both leaders
2. **Business attire** - suits or professional construction industry clothing
3. **Neutral backgrounds** - white, gray, or office setting
4. **High resolution** - minimum 300 DPI for web and print use
5. **Consistent styling** - same photographer, lighting, and background

## Alternative Options (Interim)
- Use the professional team meeting image (`img/professional-team.jpg`) as a placeholder
- Consider generic "professional silhouette" images
- Wait for actual photography before replacing placeholders

## File Names for Implementation
Once professional photos are available:
- `img/michael-sanchez.jpg`
- `img/vanessa-sanchez.jpg`

## Security Considerations
For government contractors, personal photos should be:
- Professional and appropriate for DOE/LANL client meetings
- High quality to reflect company standards
- Consistent with security clearance requirements
- Suitable for both web and printed marketing materials

**Recommendation: Schedule professional photography for authentic leadership representation.**
